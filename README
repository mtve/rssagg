Simple RSS aggregator in perl
- minimum CPAN dependencies
- single html page of output

Inputs:
	rss.list - text file with feeds urls, rss/rdf/atom are supported

Outputs:
	rss.data - binary file with last states of feeds (Last-modified, Etag
            and hashes of articles seen)
	index.html - fresh digest
	1.html .. 9.html - rotated previous digests

How to run:
	./rssagg.pl <DIRECTORY>

When started from terminal it prints a dot after fetching of each url,
otherwise it's silent (for cronjob).
